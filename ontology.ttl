    dcterms:title "PLATO — Place Attestation Ontology"@en ;
    dcterms:description """
        An ontology for representing historical place knowledge as attestations:
        bundles of evidence linking Things (places, routes, networks, and other
        entities related to place) to Names, Geometries, Timespans, Types, and
        Authorities with full provenance.

        Developed by the Pelagios Network's Place Working Group, led by the
        Institute for Spatial History Innovation (ISHI), University of Pittsburgh.

        PLATO formalises the WHG v4 data model, in which the Attestation is
        the fundamental unit of contributed knowledge. It unifies and supersedes
        the Linked Places Format (LPF) and Linked Traces.

        CIDOC-CRM alignment is provided as a separate mapping layer (see
        alignments/cidoc-crm.ttl) rather than embedded in the core ontology.
        PLATO is an identity-and-evidence model; CRM is treated as an
        interoperability target, not a design constraint.

# Qualification: Uncertainty, Fuzziness, and Relativity
# =============================================================================
# Three distinct concepts that can apply to any facet node (Name, Geometry,
# Timespan, Type) or to an Attestation as a whole:
#
#   Uncertainty — epistemic: there is a fact of the matter, but the evidence
#   is insufficient to determine it precisely. "The battle was somewhere near
#   here, but we're not sure exactly where." Uncertainty can in principle be
#   resolved by better evidence.
#
#   Fuzziness — ontological: the referent itself has no sharp boundary.
#   "The region of Burgundy" has genuinely vague spatial extent; no amount of
#   evidence will resolve it to a crisp polygon. A name used inconsistently
#   across sources is fuzzy, not uncertain. A gradual political transition
#   is a fuzzy timespan. Fuzziness is a property of the thing being described,
#   not of our knowledge of it.
#
#   Relativity — the facet is defined not in absolute terms but in relation
#   to an anchor entity. "20km east of Nanjing" is a relative geometry.
#   "During the reign of Justinian" is a relative timespan. "Also known as
#   Rum" (i.e. relative to the name "Rome") is a relative name. The anchor
#   may be a Thing or another facet node.
#
# These three concepts are orthogonal. A relative geometry can also be
# uncertain ("roughly 20km east") or fuzzy ("in the hinterland of Nanjing").

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Qualification properties (applicable to any facet node)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These properties have no rdfs:domain constraint, so they can be applied
# to Geometry, Timespan, Name, Type, or any other node that needs qualifying.
